# Towards a structured workflow

<b>What is it actually?</b>

Briefly put, the meaning of 'workflow' in a general sense may be summarized as 

<blockquote>
"[...] an abstraction of an automated and computerized business 
process. It consists of a set of activities that are interconnected by control 
flows [...]. Each activity is a naturally defined task in a workflow and has 
associated servers that are either humans or executions of programs commonly 
called processes [...]." [@Son2001]
</blockquote>

Accordingly, from an R perspective, the term typically describes a set of 
interconnected scripts and functions which sequentially perform individual 
tasks to generate a desired result. In the majority of cases, such workflows
rely on certain input data based on which some statistical metrics or figures
shall be produced.

<b>What's the use of it?</b>

This section will introduce you to two fundamental pillars of a structured 
workflow in R, namely 

* _Git version control_ in Section \@ref(git) and
* _RStudio projects_ in Section \@ref(rproj).

While the former is meant to separate the single projects you are working on 
and, at the same time, keep your stuff together in unique project-related 
working directories, the latter helps you to keep track of your single R code 
snippets and, more precisely, the changes you (or somebody else) made over time.



## Git version control {#git}

<b>What is it actually?</b>

GitHub is an online interface which hosts and provides access to the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
version control system. Briefly, the software enables multiple users to work on a single 
(code) project, or workflow, without the need to share a common network. 
Following the principles of distributed revision control, each change to a file 
or folder is recorded, thus making any edit you've made comprehensible for other 
developers &ndash; and also making it easy to undo changes if something went terribly 
wrong! 

For example, a short web-based tutorial to get started with the program is 
available from [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). At this 
point, we would like to invite you to take this roughly ten-minute tour to get 
used to the basic `git` commands that we are going to use repeatedly during the 
subsequent lessons.

<br><b>Initialize a new online code repository</b>

Let's get back to our own personal R business now. In order to be able to add version 
control to an RStudio project later on, you are required to create a 
user account at [GitHub](https://github.com/). This involves the specification 
of a username, e-mail address, and password only and goes without giving 
away personal data. 

Once your account has been created and you've successfully logged in, select 
'New repository' from the 'Create new...' (plus sign) drop-down menu in the 
top-right corner to create a new GitHub code repository. 

<br>

<br>

Now, enter 'advanced-programming-in-r' as repository name and, optionally, 
provide a short description of the data it contains (or, more precisely, the 
data that it is supposed to contain in the future). Finally, hit the 'Create 
repository' button to complete the setup process.

<br>

<br>

So far, the code repository thus created is available online only. In order to get a local copy on your hard disk, copy the link to be found when hitting the green 'Clone or download' button on the main webpage of your GitHub repository. Next, open up a Git Bash or Terminal (depending on your operating system) and navigate to the folder where you intend to save local copies of your Git repositories in the future. Finally, run 

```
git clone https://github.com/fdetsch/advanced-programming-in-r.git
```

(remember to replace the name) et voil√†, all files associated with your online code repository are being downloaded to your destination folder. From now on, this will be the place for you to realize your coding work and, at the end of a day's work, commit any changes to the online repository to better keep track of the latest changes to your code.

<br><b>Task: Create a local SSH key</b>

Before we can push files to the newly created online code repository, we 
have to create a SSH key (if not already present) for the local machine you are 
currently working on. For this purpose, follow the official GitHub tutorial on 
[Generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) 
and, if necessary, create a SSH key locally and add it in your online account 
settings.

<br>

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/demo_app.git
git push origin master
```

Now that you successfully set up your (maybe first) own code repository, it is time to 
move on to the second crucial step towards establishing a consistently structured 
workflow in R: Setting up an RStudio Project and trace your tedious coding work using 
Git version control.



## RStudio projects {#rproj}

RStudio projects (`.Rproj`) are a handy solution to keep all the files related to 
a specific workflow, including

* _R scripts_ (`.R`),
* _workspace_ (`.RData`),
* _history_ (`.Rhistory`), 
* _datasets_, 
* etc., 

together in one working directory. RStudio projects, once opened, are 
automatically associated with the directory the `.Rproj` file is located in, thus 
rendering unnecessary the use of `setwd()`.

<br><b>Starting a new project</b>

From inside RStudio, projects are easily initialized and associated with either

* a brand new working directory, 
* an existing directory or
* a local copy of a version control repository (of which more later on)

by hitting the 'New Project...' button from the drop-down menu at the top-right 
corner.

<br><b>Working with projects</b>

Once created, RStudio automatically switches to the new project (not without 
asking if you'd like to safe your latest changes, of course). If you desire to 
work with an already existing project instead, you may simply open the referring 
`.Rproj` file either via the drop-down menu in the top-right corner, or just 
double-click it within your system's file explorer. Note that, among others, 
the following actions are taken when a project opens inside RStudio (taken 
directly from the [RStudio Support Team](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects):

* a new R session is started;
* the `.Rprofile` in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced;
* the recent workspace stored in `.RData` in the project's main directory is loaded (if indicated by the 
project options);
* the `.Rhistory` file in the project's main directory is loaded into the RStudio 
'History' pane and available for console up/down arrow command history;
* previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs.

Similarly, when you quit a project, 

* the `.RData` and `.Rhistory` are being saved (if indicated by the 
project options); 
* the currently active R scripts are being saved;
* the current R session is terminated.

<br><b>Task: Create your own RStudio project</b>

Now it's your turn: Initialize a new RStudio project in the `advanced-programming-in-r` subfolder from Section \@ref(git), i.e. the one with Git version control enabled! For that purpose, 

* choose an existing directory rather than a new one and 

<br>

</center>
<br>

* navigate to the `advanced-programming-in-r` subfolder that you have copied from GitHub earlier using `git clone`.

<br>

</center>
<br>

After having accomplished this, 

* `git add` all the stuff that has accumulated in the local project directory so far (mostly `.Rproj` related files) 
* followed by `git commit` (including a meaningful description of your recent actions) 
* and, finally, `git push`. 

It is totally up to you whether to use the built-in RStudio interface to be found in the top-right 'Git' pane or run `git` from the command line. Due to its ease of use, I highly encourage you to choose option #1, though.

To verify that everything worked as expected, head over to the web-based representation of your code repository on GitHub. In addition, don't forget that you may use `git status` at any stage to get further information on the status quo of the Git processing chain. There's also a [comprehensive tutorial on version control with Git (and SVN)](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) on the RStudio support website if you wish to gather further insights into the topic.
