# Towards a structured workflow

<b>What is it actually?</b>

Briefly put, the meaning of 'workflow' in a general sense may be summarized as 

<blockquote>
"[...] an abstraction of an automated and computerized business 
process. It consists of a set of activities that are interconnected by control 
flows [...]. Each activity is a naturally defined task in a workflow and has 
associated servers that are either humans or executions of programs commonly 
called processes [...]." [@Son2001]
</blockquote>

Accordingly, from an R perspective, the term typically describes a set of 
interconnected scripts and functions, which sequentially perform individual 
tasks to generate a desired result. In the majority of cases, such workflows
rely on certain input data based on which some statistical metrics or figures
shall be produced.

<b>What's the use of it?</b>

This section will introduce you to two fundamental pillars of a structured 
workflow in R, i.e. 

* [_RStudio projects_](projects.html) and
* [_GitHub version control_](version_control.html).

While the former is meant to separate the single projects you are working on 
and, at the same time, keep your stuff together in unique project-related 
working directories, the latter helps you to keep track of your single R code 
snippets and, more precisely, the changes you (or somebody else) made over time.


## RStudio projects

RStudio projects (`.Rproj`) are a handy solution to keep all the files related to 
a specific workflow, including

* _R scripts_ (`.R`),
* _workspace_ files (`.RData`),
* _history_ files (`.Rhistory`), 
* required _datasets_, 
* etc., 

together in one working directory. RStudio projects, once opened, are 
automatically associated with the directory the .Rproj file is located in, thus 
rendering unnecessary the use of `setwd()`.

<b>Starting a new project</b>

From inside RStudio, projects are easily initialized and associated with either

* a brand new working directory, 
* an existing directory or
* a local copy of a version control repository (of which more later on)

by hitting the 'New Project...' button from the drop-down menu at the top-right 
corner.

<b>Working with projects</b>

Once created, RStudio automatically switches to the new project (not without 
asking if you'd like to safe your latest changes, of course). If you desire to 
work with an already existing project instead, you may simply open the referring 
.Rproj file either via the drop-down menu in the top-right corner, or just 
double-click it within your system's file explorer. Note that, amongst others, 
the following actions are taken when a project opens inside RStudio (taken 
directly from 
https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects):

* a new R session is started;
* the `.Rprofile` file in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced;
* the `.RData` file in the project's main directory is loaded (if indicated by the 
project options);
* the `.Rhistory` file in the project's main directory is loaded into the RStudio 
'History' pane and available for Console Up/Down arrow command history;
* previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs.

Similarly, when you quit a project, 

* the related `.RData` and `.Rhistory` files are being saved (if indicated by the 
project options); 
* the currently active R scripts are being saved;
* the current R session is terminated.

For any further information, you are kindly referred to the [official RStudio 
support website on using projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

<b>Task: Create your own RStudio project</b>

Now it's up to you! You are required to initialize a new (and empty) RStudio 
project called 'advanced-programming-in-r'. For that purpose, 

* choose a new directory rather than an existing one (don't worry, we'll take 
care of version control later) and 

![new_directory](http://i.imgur.com/B6UC3Xh.png?1)

* initialize an empty project (pop-up dialog not shown) with GitHub version 
control enabled.

![add_version_control](http://i.imgur.com/fTjwmmi.png)

Now that you successfully set up your own personal RStudio project, it's time to 
move on to the next crucial step towards establishing a consistently structured 
workflow in R: tracing your tediously developed coding work with 
[GitHub version control](version_control.html).


## GitHub version control

<b>What is it actually?</b>

GitHub is an online version control system which hosts and provides access 
(including a web-based graphical interface) to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
repositories. Briefly, the software enables multiple users to work on a single 
(code) project, or workflow, without the need to share a common network. 
Following the principles of distributed revision control, each change to a file 
or folder is recorded, thus making any edit you've made comprehensible for other 
developers - and also making it easy to undo changes if something went terribly 
wrong! A short browser tutorial to get started with the program is e.g. 
available from [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). At this 
point, we would like to invite you to take this roughly ten-minute tour to get 
used to the basic `git` commands that we're gonna use repeatedly during the 
subsequent lessons.

<b>Initialize a new online code repository</b>
Let's get back to our own personal R business now. In order to add version 
control to your newly established RStudio project, you are required to create a 
user account at [GitHub](https://github.com/). This involves the specification 
of a username, an e-mail address and a password only and goes without giving 
away personal data. 

Once your account has been created and you've successfully logged in, select 
'New repository' from the 'Create new...' (plus sign) drop-down menu in the 
top-right corner to create a new GitHub code repository. 

![new_repository](http://i.imgur.com/N4ni6RY.png)

Now, enter 'advanced-programming-in-r' as repository name and, optionally, 
provide a short description of the data it contains (or, more precisely, the 
data that it is supposed to contain in the future). Finally, hit the 'Create 
repository' button to complete the setup process.

<b>Establishing the link</b>

So far, that's all the web browser-based work required to add GitHub 
functionality to your project. Back in RStudio, open the shell from the 'More' 
drop-down menu in the top-right pane. 

![add_remote](http://i.imgur.com/AWI8Bpq.png)

<hr> 

<b>Task: Create a local SSH key</b>

Before we can push new commits to the newly created online code repository, we 
have to create a SSH key (if not already present) for the local machine you are 
currently working on. For this purpose, follow the official GitHub tutorial on 
[Generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) 
and, if necessary, create a SSH key locally and add it in your online account 
settings. 

<center>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Hourglass_2.svg" alt="hourglass" style="width: 125px;"/>
</center>

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/demo_app.git
git push origin master
```

Now, let's see how much you remember from the above Git online tutorial. Try to 
link your local .git repository to the 'advanced-programming-in-r' online 
repository you've created during the previous step! After having accomplished 
this, `git add` all the stuff that has accumulated in the local project 
directory so far followed by `git commit` (including a meaningful description of your recent 
actions) and, finally, `git push`. 

Have a look at the web-based representation 
of your code repository to see if everything worked out fine. Don't forget that 
you may use `git status` at any stage to get further information on the status 
quo of the Git processing chain. There's also a [comprehensive tutorial on version control with Git (and SVN) on the RStudio support website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) if you wish to gather further insights into the topic.
