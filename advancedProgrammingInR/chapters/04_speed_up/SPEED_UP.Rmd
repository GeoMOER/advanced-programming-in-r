# Speeding up iteration procedures

At this stage, we assume that you've grown familiar with R's most relevant loop 
constructs, including `for` loops and the `*apply` family of functions. Yet, 
there's two other packages we'd like to introduce within the scope of this short 
course due to their convenient performance when it comes to accelerating certain 
operations. But first things first... here's the topics (and the related 
packages) that we're gonna cover in the upcoming section on speeding up 
iteration procedures in R.

### Parallelization via `doParallel` (and `foreach`)

Just a bit of theory ahead.

<blockquote>
"Speedup is a common measure of the performance gain from a parallel processor. 
It is defined as the ratio of the time required to complete the job with one 
processor to the time required to complete the job with <i>N</i> processors. 
[...] In a machine where work can be dynamically assigned to available 
processors, it is attained as long as the number of pieces of work ready for 
processing is at least <i>N</i>." `r citep(mybib[[grep("Denning", mybib)]])`
</blockquote>

Or, to cut a long story short, if you're performing one and the same iteration 
again and again, you may as well distribute an equal amount of sub-iterations to 
each processor available on your local machine. In theory, distributing an 
operation to <i>N</i> nodes would result in a 10-fold speed gain.

Enough theory - let's proceed to actual practice. We'll have a brief look at R's 
capabilities in terms of parallel processing using the **doParallel** package 
along with **foreach** (an other package to deal with loop constructs). Be 
aware, however, that there are plenty of opportunities to ["go parallel" in R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-go-parallel-in-r-basics-tips/) which you 
might want to have a look at.

### "Cross-lingual" programming via `Rcpp`

The **Rcpp** package offers a seamless integration of C++ functionality in R. 
The underlying reason why such a thing exists in the first place is rather easy 
to explain: sometimes R code is just not fast enough. But don't be afraid if you 
haven't gotten in touch with C++ so far: we're barely gonna scratch the surface 
of what is possibly when combining those two languages. In fact, our short 
excursion on the topic is merely meant to raise awareness of such things 
slumbering in the depth of the R universe. In case you'd like to learn more 
about the subject, we recommend to have a closer look at Hadley Wickham's 
comprehensive [Rcpp tutorial on Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html) or, 
if you're a fan of hard copies, Dirk Eddelbuettel's book about "Seamless R and 
C++ Integration with Rcpp".
