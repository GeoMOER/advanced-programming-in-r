# RStudio projects

RStudio projects (.Rproj) are a handy solution to keep all the files related to 
a specific workflow, including

* **R scripts** (.R),
* **workspace** files (.RData),
* **history** files (.Rhistory), 
* required **datasets**, 
* etc., 

together in one working directory. RStudio projects, once opened, are 
automatically associated with the directory the .Rproj file is located in, thus 
rendering unnecessary the use of `setwd()`.


### Starting a new project
From inside RStudio, projects are easily initialized and associated with either

* a brand new working directory, 
* an existing directory or
* a local copy of a version control repository (of which more later on)

by hitting the 'New Project...' button from the drop-down menu at the top-right 
corner.

### Working with projects
Once created, RStudio automatically switches to the new project (not without 
asking if you'd like to safe your latest changes, of course). If you desire to 
work with an already existing project instead, you may simply open the referring 
.Rproj file either via the drop-down menu in the top-right corner, or just 
double-click it within your system's file explorer. Note that, amongst others, 
the following actions are taken when a project opens inside RStudio (taken 
directly from 
https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects):

* a new R session is started;
* the .Rprofile file in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced;
* the .RData file in the project's main directory is loaded (if indicated by the 
project options);
* the .Rhistory file in the project's main directory is loaded into the RStudio 
'History' pane and available for Console Up/Down arrow command history;
* previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs.

Similarly, when you quit a project, 

* the related .RData and .Rhistory files are being saved (if indicated by the 
project options); 
* the currently active R scripts are being saved;
* the current R session is terminated.

For any further information, you are kindly referred to the [official RStudio 
support website on using projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).


### Task #1: Create your own RStudio project
Now it's up to you! You are required to initialize a new (and empty) RStudio 
project called 'advanced-programming-in-r'. For that purpose, 

* choose a new directory rather than an existing one (don't worry, we'll take 
care of version control later) and 

![new_directory](http://i.imgur.com/B6UC3Xh.png?1)

* initialize an empty project (pop-up dialog not shown) with GitHub version 
control enabled.

Now that you successfully set up your own personal RStudio project, it's time to 
move on to the next crucial step towards establishing a consistently structured 
workflow in R: tracing your tediously developed coding work with 
[GitHub version control](chapters/01_structured_workflow/version_control.md).
