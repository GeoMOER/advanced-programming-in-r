# GitHub version control

### What is it actually? 
GitHub is an online version control system which hosts and provides access 
(including a web-based graphical interface) to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
repositories. Briefly, the software enables multiple users to work on a single 
(code) project, or workflow, without the need to share a common network. 
Following the principles of distributed revision control, each change to a file 
or folder is recorded, thus making any edit you've made comprehensible for other 
developers - and also making it easy to undo changes if something went terribly 
wrong! A short browser tutorial to get started with the program is e.g. 
available from [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). At this 
point, we would like to invite you to take this roughly ten-minute tour to get 
used to the basic `git` commands that we're gonna use repeatedly during the 
subsequent lessons.

### Initialize a new online code repository
Let's get back to our own personal R business now. In order to add version 
control to your newly established RStudio project, you are required to create a 
user account at [GitHub](https://github.com/). This involves the specification 
of a username, an e-mail address and a password only and goes without giving 
away personal data. 

Once your account has been created and you've successfully logged in, select 
'New repository' from the 'Create new...' (plus sign) drop-down menu in the 
top-right corner to create a new GitHub code repository.

Now, enter 'advanced-programming-in-r' as repository name and, optionally, 
provide a short description of the data it contains (or, more precisely, the 
data that it is supposed to contain in the future). Finally, hit the 'Create 
repository' button to complete the setup process.

### Establishing the link
So far, that's all the web browser-based work required to add GitHub 
functionality to your project. Back in RStudio, open the shell from the 'More' 
drop-down menu in the top-right pane.

Now, let's see how much you remember from the above Git online tutorial. Try to 
link your local .git repository to the 'advanced-programming-in-r' online 
repository you've created during the previous step! After having accomplished 
this, `git add` all the stuff that has accumulated in the local project 
directory so far followed by `git commit` (including a meaningful description of your recent 
actions) and, finally, `git push`. 

Have a look at the web-based representation 
of your code repository to see if everything worked out fine. Don't forget that 
you may use `git status` at any stage to get further information on the status 
quo of the Git processing chain. There's also a [comprehensive tutorial on version control with Git (and SVN) on the RStudio support website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) if you wish to gather further insights into the topic.
