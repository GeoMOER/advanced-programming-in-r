### Add a new code repository
In order to add version control to your newly established RStudio 
project, you are required to create a user account at 
[GitHub](https://github.com/). This involves the specification of a username, an 
e-mail address and a password only and goes without giving away personal data. 

Once your account has been created and you've successfully logged in, select 
'New repository' from the 'Create new...' (plus sign) drop-down menu in the 
top-right corner to create a new GitHub code repository.

Now, enter 'advanced-programming-in-r' as repository name and, optionally, 
provide a short description of the data it contains (or, more precisely, the 
data that it is supposed to contain in the future). Finally, hit the 'Create 
repository' button to complete the setup process.
